## Introduction

Understanding networking is crucial in today's connected world. NetPractice helps you learn the essentials, from subnetting and IP addressing to the differences between TCP and UDP protocols. This tool provides a detailed exploration of these concepts through interactive simulations and practical exercises.

## Learning Path

### 1. Subnetting and Masks

Start by understanding the basics of subnetting and subnet masks. Subnetting divides a network into smaller, more manageable pieces, which is essential for efficient network management and security. Learn how to calculate subnets and understand the significance of subnet masks in IP addressing.

### 2. IP Addressing: Network and Hosts

Dive into IP addressing and understand the difference between network addresses and host addresses. Learn how IP addresses are assigned and managed within a network, and explore the roles of IPv4 and IPv6 in modern networking.

### 3. Packet Transmission

Explore how data packets are transmitted across networks. Understand the various methods of packet delivery, including unicast, multicast, and broadcast, and how routers and switches manage these transmissions.

### 4. TCP/IP and OSI Model Layers

Gain a thorough understanding of the TCP/IP and OSI model layers. Learn how each layer functions and interacts with the others, from the physical layer to the application layer. This knowledge is fundamental to troubleshooting and optimizing network performance.

### 5. TCP vs. UDP

Understand the differences between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Learn about their use cases, advantages, and disadvantages. Discover how TCP ensures reliable data transmission and how UDP provides faster, connectionless communication.
